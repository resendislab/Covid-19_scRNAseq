# Covid-19_scRNAseq
 In this section we present an analysis based on data of single cell RNAseq coming from patients with COVID-19 stratified through 3 levels or clinical responses: normal, covid-19 moderate, and covid-19 severe or critical. Data was obtained from this paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0901-9. In this paper the authors proceed with a BronchoALveolar lavage Fluid (BALF) of 12 patients (3 moderate M1-M3, 6 patients wit severe/critical infection S1-S6, and 3 normal controls-HC1-HC3).
